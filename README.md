# AQI Globe

AQI Globe is a Streamlit app that shows the Air Quality Index (AQI) values of different cities around the world in a nice visual way. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is, and it is based on different pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3).

Users can interact with the app by selecting a country and city from the dropdown menu, or by using the search bar to find a specific city. The app also allows users to sort the cities by different criteria such as AQI value, pollutant concentration, and city name.
